% function header = read_tiff_header(filename)
%
%   filename is a string corresponding to a TV6 tiff file on disk
%   returns header, a structure containing all the header information of the
%  TIFF file.
%

%   uses read_tiff_header.mex.c which calls tiff_reading.c
%   Doesn't currently work.
%   Problem seems to involve linux mex compiler but let's not go there.
