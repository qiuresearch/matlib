<br><font size=+3><b>Comparison of MOA and TV6</b></font></center>
<font size=+1></font>
<p><br><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>MOA and TV6 are so dissimilar comparison is almost impossible.
TV6 is a data acquistion and analysis package. MOA is a toolkit of functions
for image analysis. The only way they can be compared is with respect to
a particular task. Even here, comparison is difficult. For example, MOA
does not support peak finding since this is built into MATLAB. TV6 does
not support Guinier or Kratky Plots. Here is the best comparison I can
manage.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Correcting Images - Pretty much equivalent, but MOA can
flux correct and perform multiple image dezingering. TV6 automatically
keeps tags with images.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Displaying Images and picking out regions of interest
- TV6 is faster to use, but MOA is more flexible and has far more options.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Masking – MOA’s interface is non-intuitive, but faster
and easier than TV6’s box function.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Image arithmatic - MOA has a wider range and is far more
flexible but requires a knowledge of MATLAB syntax.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Calibration – MOA’s calibration proceedure is terrible,
but does support off-screen beam centres. TV6’s calibration proceedure
is smooth and precise but does not support off-screen beam centres.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Integration – TV6 has far more options, but MOA’s function
is smooth and quick.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Graphing plots - MOA supports legends, axis labels, titles,
multiple plots and allows full mathematical manipulation including Guinier
and Kratky plots. TV6 is very quick.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Peak finding - TV6 has a good peak finder. MOA has nothing.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Scripting, function writing - MOA is vastly superior.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In short, TV6 and MOA are such different entities comparison
is impossible. MOA performs tasks TV6 doesn’t. TV6 performs tasks MOA doesn’t.</font>
