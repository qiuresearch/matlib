</B></FONT>
<P>If you are new to Matlab, on firing it up type &quot;helpdesk&quot; at the command prompt.  This will bring up a browser with just a little of Matlab’s documentation.  The &quot;Using Matlab&quot; option is a good introduction to the elementary features of Matlab.  The manuals are also online which are always good for a read.  In particular, don’t neglect the amazing power of Matlab through pre-existing functions, toolboxs, scripting and the ability to build interpreted functions online.</P>

<P>However, if you know the general area you are interested in (eg. &quot;graphing&quot; or &quot;file i/o&quot;) but just don’t know your options or can’t remember the name of the desired function, then the command, &quot;helpwin&quot;, may be the way to go.  This spawns a set of hierarchal windows listing functions in relatively logical groups.</P>

<P>Alternatively, if you remember the command, or an associated command, typing,</P>

<P>&#9;help &quot;function_name&quot; </P>

<P>will produce a handy little memory prompt.  This feature is available for all the functions in this library, although the help can be a trifle obscure.</P>
