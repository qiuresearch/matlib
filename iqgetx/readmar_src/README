The program readmar is a small program to read in mar345 formatted images. 
It's originally used for c programming. Now with the help of powerful tool 
of mex function, it’s the first time that MATLAB can read mar345 formatted
images directly.

The compiling command is above:

mex -o readmar readmar.c mar300_header.c mar345_header.c pck.c swap.c utils.c

If you compile it in Linux, you will get readmar.mexa64 file; 
if you compile it on Mac, you will get readmar.mexmaci64. 

mymarreader.m is the ultimate script based on mexa64 file and mexmaci64 file.
It’s feature is to read mar2300 file and output the image matrix as well as 
output it as a tif image file. 

For more details of mymarreader.m, just type help mymarreader.m.
